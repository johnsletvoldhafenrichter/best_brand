This is a project that was created during my code institute studies and is supposed to showcase Django coding skill.

The project includes email verification and stripe for credit card authentication.

#### Stripe is set up as a testing environment so in case you want to check out the functionality use:

* 4242 4242 4242 4242 as a card number

All other numbers on the card validation can be anything.

if you don't want to use your own email for verification than i suggest you use https://temp-mail.org/ for quick validation.

#### You may also browse without any user or use the test user I've created:

* Username: test
* Password: test
